  Right now we are predicting all 3s
  
Response Variables
  Number_of_Casualties- quartile, mean, median all about 1, we might not want to use this
  Severity – Very large amount of 3s (Could be harder to use, but this is one of the major questions in the document)

Variable Selection
  Lat/Long don’t seem to buy us anything
  Create morning, afternoon, evening, overnight out of Time variable
